# Pwnagotchi Christmas Countdown

Christmas Countdown Timer for Pwnagotchi

#### Since this is my first Pwnagotchi plugin, I used some code from memtemp.

## Installation

To install, first set your directory for custom plugins in your config file.  
In `main` add `custom_plugins: "/custom/plugins/directory"`

After that, add `christmas.py` to that folder.
Finally, enable it in your config.yml.  

    plugins:
      christmas:
         enabled: true

## FAQ

### The plugin doesn't work!

Bother me in my [discord server](https://discord.gg/VuhvYRz) (I am Logandev\_)

### Does it overlap memtemp?

Nope, it moves the Christmas countdown over to the side if memtemp is enabled, so it won't overlap.

## TO-DO

Future-proof it so it works on Christmas(s) above 2019.
