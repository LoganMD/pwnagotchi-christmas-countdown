# pwnagotchi-christmas-countdown
Christmas Countdown Timer for Pwnagotchi
#### Since this is my first pwnagotchi plugin, I used some code from memtemp.
## Installation
To install, first set your directory for custom plugins in your config file.  
In `main` add `custom_plugins: "/custom/plugins/directory"`

After that, add `christmas.py` to that folder.
Finally, enable it in your config.yml.  
`christmas:  
enabled: true`
## FAQ
### The app doesnt work!
Bother me in my [discord server](https://discord.gg/VuhvYRz) (I am Logandev_)
### Does it overlap memtemp?
Nope, it moves the christmas countdown over to the side if memtemp is enabled, so it won't overlap.
